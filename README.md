# Penguin on fire
This is a game about a penguin named Nolan has just left his habitat, Antarctica, after an ice melt destroyed his village. 
In search of a new home in space, he becomes lost on a volcanic planet called Volkrion. To survive, he must gather food 
supplies—watermelons and bananas—until he reaches the end and advances to the next stage of his salvation. However, his 
journey will not be easy: he will face what will become his worst enemies, the Evil Mushrooms, who will try to destroy him 
to prevent him from escaping Volkrion and creating a new penguin civilization on another planet.
